The letter arrived with neither sound nor herald, slipped beneath the door as if carried by no hand. Its paper bore the texture of old parchment, the corners uneven, the surface faintly luminous under dim light. A golden seal, depicting an intricate sigil, held the edges together, radiating warmth to the touch.

Unfolding it revealed a script unlike any known tongue yet understood as if the words whispered their meanings directly into the mind.

"Enter through the Splintered Gate. Seek the Stag's bloodstained crown."

The instructions pulsed with an urgency, a pull as though the very fabric of the Mansus awaited an answer. A faint fragrance of ink and something ancient lingered in the air, teasing a memory half-formed and deeply buried.

Who could resist such a summons?
